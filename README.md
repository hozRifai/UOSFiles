# uosfiles
I have worked tirelessly to collect the vast majority of files to save it in one place. UosFiles has meant to help UOS students to get the best grades through providing them with previous quizzes, midterms and finals.
## Help
It looks like i will not buy a domain and a server for the website . The sole reason for that is the poor support from students cause i havent seen what i was expecting. they werent that excited to upload whatever files they have to our serve, although we are using s3 server for now but this will not stay forever.
If you are willing to imporve the website or you have noticed some bugs in my code please make a pull request or try to raise an issue if you have faced any issues while using the webapp.
